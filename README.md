EXERCISE 1: Final project idea

I was looking for an idea which allows me to learn more about tokenization and how can incentive collaboration and knowledge sharing in a given community.

I'm thinking about creating a stack-overflow similar platform to incentive developers to post their programming questions, provide answers / solutions, vote for accepted answers, tag content, etc receiving reputation tokens as reward (let's name it KNL).

In order to keep it simple the initial scope / user flows for the project would be:

1) Create question
2) Answer question
3) Answer voting

Depending on progress and deadline the scope could be expanded to support more use cases:

1) Content tagging
2) Add tips (tokens) to get a quick answer
3) Reward users with badges modeled as NFTs (Non transferable) depending on user contributions and actions
4) Enable more privileges in the system (Add comments, edit questions / answers etc) based on current tokens / badges


Brainstorming / concerns:

The site could be anonymous (without requiring KYC) only connecting the ETH wallet to simplify the scope or require registration to tie the user identity in the network.
Build it on 2 layer solution to avoid high fees?
Tokenomics. ICO. Token distribution. Single token?.
Decentralized governance. Decision about new features, etc.
