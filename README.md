# Bootcamp final project idea

A dapp to share, organize and balance expenses with a group of people for an event or any collaborative activity (Similar to Tricount)

## Advantages over centralized app (like TriCount,etc.):

* Settlement logic is set by code 
* Expenses cannot be easily manipulated 
* It is easy to audit and trace expenses / debts
* Debts can be paid using ETH

## User stories

In order to keep it simple for learning purposes the initial scope and user stories for the project could be:

1. As a creator I want to create a new shared activity (New contract with some customizable business rules)
2. As a creator I want to add new user (participant)
3. As a user I want to retrieve my current balance
4. As a user I want to add a new expense
5. As a user I want to approve expenses for other users
6. As a user I want to be able to pay debts using ETH
7. As a user I want to be able to able to withdraw my money
....
