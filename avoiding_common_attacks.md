## Avoiding common attacks

These ones are the SWCs (Smart contract weakness classification) that initially affected to my contracts and were mitigated as it is described in SWC specifications:

* SWC-105 Unprotected Ether Withdrawal
* SWC-101 Integer Overflow and Underflow
* SWC-100 Function Default Visibility
* SWC-108 State Variable Default Visibility
* SWC-118 Incorrect Constructor Name
* SWC-131 Presence of unused variables
